## 1. Introduction
These are some configurations of docker applications adapted for the `1Panel` store version 2.0.

Dedicated to running various Docker applications with just one click. Enjoy convenience and efficiency without complex configurations.

### Repository Branch Description
- `localApps`：Main branch
- `config`: Configuration file branch, specifically for editing the configuration files of this repository
- `patch/*`: Used for temporary branches during editing
- `renovate/*`: Temporarily created by the renovatebot
- `script`: Branch for storing scripts

## 2. Usage

In the `Shell Script` task type in the `1Panel` scheduled tasks, add and execute the following command, or run the following command in the terminal:

```shell
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pooneyy/1Panel-Appstore/refs/heads/script/update_local_appstore.sh | bash
```
OR
```shell
curl -sSL https://gh-proxy.com/raw.githubusercontent.com/pooneyy/1Panel-Appstore/refs/heads/script/update_local_appstore.sh | bash
```

Then refresh the local applications in the app store.

## 3. Remarks

**If an application is not displayed in the local app list, it means it has not been fully adapted for operation in the app store panel.**

**However, it can still be run directly in the terminal.**

> Most applications in this repository support running directly with `docker-compose up`

Taking `rustdesk` as an example:

```shell
# Enter the latest version directory of rustdesk
cd /opt/1panel/resource/apps/local/rustdesk/versions/latest/

# Copy .env.sample as .env
cp .env.sample .env

# Edit the .env file and modify the parameters
nano .env

# Start RustDesk
docker-compose up -d

# View the necessary key for connecting
cat ./data/hbbs/id_ed25519.pub

```
